"Gee, I wonder why he _just_ decided to start a blog..."  

Jokes aside, welcome! I'm amsraman: a college student with a love of all things math, and the algorithmic/theoretical side of CS. These interests of mine are going to be the primary subject of this blog, although this might expand if I'm feeling it later on.

### Why am I here?

Now, on to what motivated me to start this blog -- as many who are close to me would know, I've been heavily into [competitive programming][cp wiki] for years. I started by doing the [USACO][usaco] in high school, and have continued it into college. Still, I consider it the primary way through which I regularly interact with the subjects I love.

Like any sport, almost all competitive programming websites assign players a "rating", aimed to be reflective of their performance on contests with respect to other accounts (often additional associated with colors/chess-like ranks). And universally: every major competitive programming site has some notion of "red", or the "grandmaster" rank. It's a tough thing to get... as of now there are only 23 active US accounts that are currently there on the [most popular platform][cf_main].

A long-standing goal of mine has been to hit red [on][codeforces] [multiple][atcoder] [sites][codechef]. As I have and continue to work towards that, this blog will serve as documentation and a source accountability for the work I put in: be it learning something new, doing a contest, or solving older problems. Here are some of the posts you can explect in this vain:
 * Editorials for past contests (mainly ICPC)
 * Editorials for the [CSES problem-set][cses], which I recently completed
 * Interesting topics I've learned from problems and various CP blogs, explained in my own way
 * Reflections of contests that I participated in, and what I've learned from them

I hope you'll follow me, on what I hope is my last leg on this journey.

### So... is that it?

I guess it does feel a little disingenuous to say I only study these things to make some number on a website go up.

As my time in college caught up to me, I've started asking questions. Why do I do what I do? Why did I chase after the things I did? Have I lost sight of what brought me here in the first place?

What I always loved about math was the unexpected results: the facts that you don't expect to be true, or the distinct concepts that you don't expect to be connected... until you look a little closer. A closer look that teaches you a deeper lesson on what things actually are, and makes you wonder how you didn't see it the whole time.

In a sense, that's what I love most about algorithms: the simplifications you don't expect to work or the strategies you don't expect to be fast enough... but somehow just are. Or the algorithms that you think are different...
- Splay Trees
- AKS primality test
- Matroids

The kinds of problems you see in contests are easily conducive to this kind of thinking, and even if I'm not directly competing, studying the related literature has been my most direct vessel to generally... learning more. I'm not sure where my liking for this will take me, or even if it will play a part in my next step after college.

Maybe this will serve as inspiration for future things I write. Maybe it won't. We'll see what happens.

Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. Welcome, and see you soon hopefully!
