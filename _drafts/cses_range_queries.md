Huzzah, another CSES post! This will be the range queries section, or as I like to call it, the "do a simple thing, but a linear factor faster" section. Jokes aside, I think a less-said lesson from range queries in competitive programming.

As a [well-esteemed friend] once told me, "there is only one data structure" (referring to balanced binary search trees). In a sense, he's right... any data structure that has a "log" in it probably does some subset of what a balanced binary search tree can do. Alas, competitive programming does not operate in the Word-RAM model, and we care about constants.

Most of these problems are simple, and the solutions can be explained in one line once you understand the prerequisites (a larger component of the difficulty lies in implementation). Once again, hopefully my code is of some use.

**Statement**: And most tree data structures are equivalent in their ability to be made persistent.
